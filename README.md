# Baseline solutions for the SHAD muon identification competition

[`Baseline - simple.ipynb`](https://github.com/HSE-LAMBDA/SHAD-2020-muon-id/blob/master/Baseline%20-%20simple.ipynb) contains a naive xgboost solution and creates a model file for Track 2

[`Baseline - advanced.ipynb`](https://github.com/HSE-LAMBDA/SHAD-2020-muon-id/blob/master/Baseline%20-%20advanced.ipynb) contains a primer on jagged arrays processing and creates a model file for Track 2

`track_2_baseline_advanced_cpp` contains an example submission for
Track 2 with catboost and jagged arrays in C++. Run `make all` to
build and the `baseline` binary will be accepting data as `.csv` (not
gzipped) at the standard input and writing predictions to the standard
output. Run `make compute_features` to build an utility binary that
preprocesses data and outputs the computed features.

`track_2_baseline_simple_python` contains an example submission for
Track 2 with xgboost and python. Quite slow to read the data and
doesn't have the jagged arrays.

`scoring.py` contains an implementation of the quality metric

`utils.py` contains data reading and jagged arrays processing utilities

`Evaluate advanced baseline.ipynb` compares Python and C++ predictions for Track 2
